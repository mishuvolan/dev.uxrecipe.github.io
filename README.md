# UX RECIPE

## What's new 

**Current version: 0.2**

+ Updated the design to match the new logo.

+ Added list of currencies to select from when you calculate the final sum.


**Version 0.1.2**

+ You can now save the calculation in PNG format using html2canvas (still in experimental phase).

+ Added new "supporters" section - all major blogs, websites or newsletter that shared UX Recipe.

**Version: 0.1.1**

+ Added a "Clear values" buttons - it will reset the inputs you typed.


**Version 0.1.0**

+ The Estimation Calculator has been changed based on the feed I received. Now you add your
numbers of hours. The subtotal is calculated automatically. 

+ I also merged pull requests (from contributors) and fixed other bugs.

**Version: 0.0.3**

+ Now when you print it only selects the calculations and **not** the entire page (I used @media print queries). Much more useful when budget decisions are needed to be made.  

**Version: 0.0.2**

+ I added a popover for the hashtag, incentivizing users to discover more resources. It opens after 10 seconds delays (last 5 seconds) after the page loads, but can be opened manually at any time.
+ Now you can reset your selections. The checkboxes return 
+ Small text modifications


## About the project

This project is a personal manifesto against **the objectification of the term "UX"**. It's more than UI, it's more than a PSD file.

You can use the project in **three ways**:

+ select the ux tools and techniques for your next project;
+ estimate (people, days, costs) for each and calculate the total;
+ click on the #hashtags to discover recommendations & templates for each (if you have suggestions, with no restrains, do contact me to update the list);

## Tools used
For coding this project I used the following:
[Bootstrap 3.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Labelauty](http://fntneves.github.io/jquery-labelauty/), [Sweet Alert 2](https://limonte.github.io/sweetalert2/), [Fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

PS: this project is not intended to be a coding masterpiece. I have still a lot of work to do under the hood: refinements, optimizations, reorganization etc. It's a prototype, but I will continue working and making it better (I'm fully aware the Javascript is a mess).


## Contribute
Feel free to contribute to the project in any way possible. For any feedback (like corrections, suggestions, new structure or features etc.) you can use my blog's contact form.
I can't wait to see how we can improve it together. Feel free to fork. The code I written is licensed under MIT Licence and let's keep it that way (it's only fair as it relies on projects under the same or are free to use: e.g. Bootstrap, Fontawesome, Labelauty, Sweet Alert 2).
